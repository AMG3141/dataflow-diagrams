# Data Flow Diagrams
* Maps out the flow of information for any process or system
* Shows data inputs, outputs, storage points, and routes between destinations

## Components of a DFD      

### External Entity
* Outside system that sends or receives data
* Communicates with the system in the diagram
* Sources and destinations of information entering or leaving the system
* Drawn on the edge of the diagram

### Processes
* Anything that changes the data, producing an output
* Described by a short label
<img src="Images/process.svg" alt="Process" width="108" height="90">

### Data Store
* Files which hold information for later use (eg. database)
* Has a simple label

### Data Flow
* The route that the data takes between the external entities, processes and data stores
* Shown with arrows
* Labelled with a short data name

## Levels of DFD's

### Level 0 (Context Diagram)
* Basic overview of the whole system
* Shows the sytem as a single high level process, with its relationship to external entities

## Level 1
* Provides a detailed breakout of pieces of the level 0 DFD
* Main functions of the system highlighted
* High level process of the level 0 DFD is broken down into its subprocesses

## Level 2
* Goes one step deeper into parts of the level 1 DFD
